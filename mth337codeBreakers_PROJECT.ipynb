This sign, which is a kind of voice, first began to come\\nto me when I was a child; it always forbids but never commands me to\\ndo anything which I am going to do. This is what deters me from being a\\npolitician. And rightly, as I think. For I am certain, O men of Athens,\\nthat if I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago, and\\ndone no good either to you or to myself. And do not be offended at my\\ntelling you the truth: for the truth is, that no man who goes to war\\nwith you or any other multitude, honestly striving against the many\\nlawless and unrighteous deeds which are done in a state, will save his\\nlife; he who will fight for the right, if he would live even for a brief\\nspace, must have a private station and not a public one.\\n\\n'"
